[![checks](https://github.com/pmeinhardt/maxdown/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pmeinhardt/maxdown/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Maxdown is a simple and fast Markdown-to-HTML converter. It comes with a command-line interface and an integration for (Neo)Vim.

## Before you get going üêøÔ∏è

You will need [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html) in order to build the `maxdown` command-line tool.

In case you are using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), it should be as easy as `brew install rust`.

## Installation ü™õ

### Command-line tool

If you're only interested in the `maxdown` command-line tool, you can build it by running:

```shell
cargo build --release --locked
```

Then, just put the resulting `target/release/maxdown` binary somewhere on your `PATH`.

### Vim plugin

For the Vim plugin, if you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), add this line to your Vim configuration file:

```vim
Plug 'pmeinhardt/maxdown', {'do': ':MaxdownCompile'}
```

If you have a different way of managing your Vim plugins, make sure you add the project directory to your `runtimepath` and build the command-line tool:

```sh
cargo build --release --locked
```

Or, to build from within Vim:

```
:MaxdownCompile
```

## Usage ‚å®Ô∏è

### Command-line tool

The `maxdown` command-line tool reads Markdown from `stdin` or a file and outputs HTML to `stdout` or a file.

For instance:

```sh
echo 'Hello *World*!' | maxdown -
maxdown README.md
```

To learn about the extra knobs and switches, kindly ask `maxdown` for help:

```
$ maxdown --help
Convert Markdown to HTML

Usage: maxdown [OPTIONS] <PATH>

Arguments:
  <PATH>  Path to the input markdown file or "-" for stdin

Options:
  -b, --base <url>       Base URL to use for all relative URLs in the document
      --dangerous        Only use this if you trust the authors of the document
  -o, --output <path>    File to write output to [default: stdout]
  -t, --template <path>  Template to use for output
      --title <title>    Title to pass to the template [default: Preview]
  -h, --help             Print help
  -V, --version          Print version
```

### Vim plugin

To preview the current markdown buffer, invoke `:MaxdownPreview`.

 Alternatively, define a custom mapping. For instance:

```vim
autocmd FileType markdown nnoremap <buffer> <localleader>m <Plug>MaxdownPreview
```

This will create a normal-mode mapping to preview the current markdown buffer.

To replace the current Markdown buffer's content with the corresponding HTML, use `:MaxdownConvert`.

If you have other use cases, you always have the option of defining your own custom commands and mappings using the command-line tool.

## Enhancements ü™Ñ

With the `ql` [Vim plugin](https://github.com/pmeinhardt/ql), previews on macOS will look more neat (no `[DEBUG]` in the title):

```vim
Plug 'pmeinhardt/ql', {'do': ':QuickLookCompile'}
```
