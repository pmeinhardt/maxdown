# Maxdown ðŸš²

<!-- TODO: Insert screenshot -->

## Before you get going

You will need [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html) in order to build the `maxdown` command-line tool.

The Vim plugin is currently only targeted at [macOS](https://support.apple.com/macos).

## Installation

If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), add this line to your Vim configuration file:

```vim
Plug 'pmeinhardt/maxdown', {'do': ':MaxdownCompile'}
```

If you have a different way of managing your Vim plugins, make sure you add the project directory to your `runtimepath` and build the command-line tool:

```sh
cargo build --release --locked
```

Or from within Vim:

```
:MaxdownCompile
```

## Usage

The plugin does not define any mappings by default. You can invoke `:MaxdownPreview` from within a Markdown buffer or define a custom mapping.

For instance:

```vim
autocmd FileType markdown nnoremap <buffer> <localleader>m <Plug>MaxdownPreview
```

This will create a normal-mode mapping to preview the current markdown buffer.
